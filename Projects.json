    "description": "Modeled with the goal of a low triangle count, this project really helped me improve my low-poly modelling skills. It also served as a very helpful introduction into map making, especially with player navigation in mind. Though certainly not made with graphical beauty in mind, this map certainly holds its own. It also uses a palette to reach its' miniscule file size.[NEWLINE]The bottom deck features assets of many different types. When looking over the timelapse I took of modelling this project, I realized just how many assets I had to delete because of their high poly counts. Barrels and spherical objects were some of the biggest culprits"

In this render specifically, I used a volumetric for the beam of the lighthouse, something that, though actually low-poly itself, provides some extra depth to the scne, different from the harsh lines on the rest of the landscape"

Along the way, I learned to reproduce a lot of the styles used in the publicized material for the former Pixel 4 & Pixel 4 XL.[NEWLINE]This taught me a lot about product advertisement, something that I haven't used yet, but fun nevertheless! I was especially intrigued by the smooth animations used, something that took me awhile to get down, but later allowed me to create a bunch of (looping!) ad renders for my concept"

Given that I had no real-life counterpart and nothing but some vauge promotional materials to work off of, I really like the way this turned out. The creases coming from the corners are very visible, something I struggled to get less apparent. Though this model creates more of a V from the corners to the middle, it still represents the model pretty well imo.[NEWLINE]Though I tend to forget it myself, this model is actually only the top part of the xbox, under there it's just a flat bottom, no detailing, which definitely made modelling it easier"
